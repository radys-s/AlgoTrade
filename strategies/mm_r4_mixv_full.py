exp_r3_seq (home): mm_r3_mlp2 with seq_on 1 = the taker MLP replaced by a GRU (13-dim event token -> 16 hidden,
state carried over every market event) + the same 22 hand features into a 38-64-32-1 head (research/diag/seq_r3.py,

mm_r3_mlp2 (home, R3 candidate): mm_r3_mlp with the g3 passive thresholds (fq_k_sp2 2.0, fq_k_sp3 1.5, rt_ms 130, gate_thr 11) and

mm_r3_pms (home, R3 upload candidate): mm_r3_ins + a ridge predictor refitted on round 3 (first 75 %, 150 ms target, lean
22 features) driving the IOC taker (pms_on 1, pred_blend 0.5, pred_scale 1.0; passive quotes keep fair_sig).
Subagent pms: round3 413,750 / mirror 411,861 (base 339,285), holdout 104,902 / 105,585 (base 87,007), 4/4 chunks.

mm_r3_ins (home, R3 insurance): our R2 final (mm_r2_final, R2 leaderboard 974,031) with the round-2 ridge switched off (pred_on 0).
round3 339,285 / round3_mirror 339,285 (holdout 87,007, 7/8 chunks); with the R2 ridge 338,970 / 342,176 but holdout

mm_r2_final (home, R2 last upload): mm_r2_rth (leaderboard 970,101) + passive refinements only, taker unchanged

round2 + round2_mirror 863,925 vs 860,077 for mm_r2_rth (leaderboard 970,101); both tapes up (+0.8k..+2.3k), i.e. a
small refinement: the 200-lot flip quote from a 0.3-tick lean (was 0.45), and at a spread >= 3 the lean threshold 0.3
(spread 2 keeps 0.7).

mm_r2_rth (home, R2 leaderboard candidate): mm_r2_rts + a stricter quote over a hole behind the touch.

hk_gap 3 / hk_k 0.8: when the next market level behind our side's touch is >= 3 ticks away, the touch quote needs
F_hat >= 0.8 ticks inside it (fq_k 0.05 otherwise): a sweep that takes the level runs through the hole (fills where the
sweep went deeper mark out -1.5 ticks/lot). round2 + round2_mirror 860,077 vs 840,149 for mm_r2_rts (both tapes ~+10k);
hk_gap 2 858,284. mm_r2_rts: fq_k_sp2 0.7, rt_ms 20, qs_k 0.45 (leaderboard 957,133).

exp_r2_rt (home, R2): mm_r2_zd + no passive quote on a touch that just retreated (+ qs_k / qs_weak as exp_r2_qsw).

round2 anatomy: market fills at a level the touch RETREATED onto mark out -0.57 / -0.42 ticks (0-50 / 50-200 ms), at a
fresh level made by an improving insert +0.64. rt_ms: after the bid touch falls (ask touch rises) the side's passive
quote is pulled for rt_ms; 0 = off (identical to mm_r2_zd).

mm_r2_zd (home, R2 leaderboard candidate): mm_r2_pred (gate 8 / 30 s) + zero-delay take (the flip IOC goes out in the
same callback as the cancel of our blocking passive quote; a guard IOC trims any |I| > 100 at once) + zero-delay
requote toward the market (zd_quote 2), quote_size 200. Subagent A. round2 local: see progress.md (2026-11-07 22:55).
Leaderboard: mm_r2_pred 797,904.

exp_r2_new_a: mm_r2_pred2 + zero-delay take (zd_take). Base = mm_r2_pred2 (home, R2 candidate): mm_r2_pred with gate_window 20 s, gate_thr 10 (fq_take_k 0.2): robust across regimes:
round2 378,507 (+6.5k), round1 480,854 (+39k), sample_v2 267,440 vs mm_r2_pred. Leaderboard: mm_r2_fq2 740,067, mm_r2_pred 797,904.

mm_r2_pred (home, R2 candidate): exp_r2_pred baked with pred_on 1, pred_mode 1 (the prediction drives only the
IOC taker test; passive quotes keep fair_sig), pred_blend 0.5 (taker signal = 0.5 ridge + 0.5 fair_sig), pred_scale 1.0,
fq_take_k 0.2, pred_model 0 (ridge fitted on the first 75 % of round2). round2 371,961 (hold 106,650, 8/8),
mirror 369,664, round1 441,626, sample_v2 265,868.

exp_r2_pred (home, R2): mm_r2_fq2 with a better F_hat - mid predictor fed to the fair taker/quoter.

research/diag/oracle_fair.py: with the REAL 150 ms move instead of fair_sig the same strategy makes 935k, so the
predictor is the bottleneck. research/diag/pred_r2.py fits a ridge (no winsorizing: the edge is in the tails) on
fair_sig at taus 20/50/70/150/300 ms, its decayed insert count, touch queues/imbalance, trade flow, last trade and
the book-hole offset, target = robust mid (spread <= 3) at t+5ms+150ms minus the current mid (ticks, the unit _fq
adds to the mid). Holdout (last 25 % of round2) corr 0.417 vs fair_sig 0.392; mean move in the top 1/3/6 % of
|pred| 3.45/2.15/1.47 ticks vs 2.91/1.86/1.31 for |fair_sig|.
  * pred_on: 1 = _fq uses pred_scale * prediction instead of fair_sig. 0 = identical to mm_r2_fq2.
  * pred_model: 0 = ridge fitted on the first 75 % of round2 (honest holdout), 1 = fitted on 100 %,
    2 = the same features with a 100 ms target (first 75 %).
  * pred_blend: the signal used is pred_blend * prediction + (1 - pred_blend) * fair_sig (1 = the prediction only).
  * pred_mode: 0 = the prediction drives both the IOC taker test and the passive quotes, 1 = taker test only
    (quotes keep fair_sig), 2 = quotes only (the taker keeps fair_sig).
Features use only market flow (our own IOC trades are skipped) and market orders at the touch.

mm_r2_fq2 (home, R2 candidate): mm_r2_fq with tau 70 ms, fq_take 200 (one IOC can reverse a full position),
fq_take_k 0.2, gate_thr 8. round2 349,077 (8/8, chunk_min +15.8k).

mm_r2_fq (home, R2 candidate): exp_r2_fq baked with the subagent's best cell: aggressive hidden-fair IOC taker (100 lots
whenever F_hat is beyond the opposite touch by 0.25 ticks, re-entry on every book update) + touch quotes only on the side F favours,
fair over 20 levels, mid at any spread, 30 s gate thr 6. round2 341,105 (8/8 chunks, chunk_min +14.6k), round1 377k, sample_v2 253k, check PASS 1.3 min.

exp_r2_fq (home, R2): exp_r2_fair turned into a FAIR-CENTRIC quoter.

The generator centres new limit orders and IOC limit prices on a hidden fair price F, and the visible mid lags it.
Instead of joining the touch and only pulling the side the signal is against, quote around the estimate
F_hat = mid + fq_scale * fair_sig (mid = the last normal mid, spread <= 3, so book holes do not move it):
  * fq_k: desired bid = floor(F_hat - fq_k), ask = ceil(F_hat + fq_k). Passive quotes are clamped to at most fq_inside
    ticks inside the market touch (never crossing it); a side whose price would be more than fq_max_behind ticks
    behind the market touch is not quoted. fq_k 0 = off (identical to exp_r2_fair under the same params).
  * fq_take / fq_slip / fq_take_cooldown_ms: when the desired bid reaches the market ask (F_hat far above), the
    passive bid is pulled (its room frees once CANCELED arrives) and an IOC buy at ask + fq_slip for up to fq_take
    lots goes out, at most once per cooldown, within the invariant; mirror for the ask. 0 = never cross (the quote
    stays clamped inside the spread).
  * fq_tol: keep a resting quote whose desired price is within fq_tol ticks (a cancel costs the ~700-lot queue).
  * fq_take_k: > 0 = the crossing test uses this half-width instead of fq_k (decouples the taker threshold).
  * fair_mid_any: 1 = the pre-insert mid is updated at any two-sided spread (lead's fix, strategies/exp_r2_taker.py);
    with fair_levels 20 the online signal matches the offline one. 0 = only while the spread is <= 3 (as exp_r2_fair).
  * fq_level: 1 = use (time-decayed mean of insert price - side offset) - mid instead of fair_sig, i.e. the
    devs are not measured against the mid at their own insert time (the mid catching up does not double count).

exp_r2_fair (home, R2): mm_r2_gate + the hidden-fair filter (radys findings s.11).

The generator places new limit orders around a hidden fair price, so every new market limit order is a noisy look at
it: dev = price - side offset - mid before the insert (offsets ~ -1.2 bids / +1.2 asks on round2, estimated online).
sig = time-decayed mean of dev (fair_tau_ms) over new inserts, found as market order ids above the highest id seen
in the first fair_levels price levels of each side (a new limit order is the last order of its level).
research/diag/fair_fills.py: our maker fills with the signal against us (buy with sig < 0, sell with sig > 0) lose
-305k at 1 s on the plain maker, those with it on our side win +106k.
  * fair_thr: pull the bid while sig < -fair_thr, the ask while sig > +fair_thr. 0 = off (identical to mm_r2_gate).

mm_r2_gate (home, R2 candidate): exp_r2_ladder with gate_thr 4, gate_max_spread 3, park_size 0, gate_rungs 1 baked in.
round2 86,333 (8/8 chunks, chunk_min +95, holdout 44,739). A passive trend follower: the against-trend side is pulled
while the robust 30 s mid drift is beyond 4 ticks, so inventory rides the minute-scale drift.

exp_r2_ladder (home, R2): exp_ladder_home (mm_park + standing rungs) + the round-2 trend gate.

Why (round2 anatomy, research/diag/queue_age.py): market orders live ~0.3 s, so an order parked at a
level >= 1 s before that level becomes the touch is at the very FRONT of the queue 84 % of the time
(2 s: 97 %). The front-of-queue oracle on round2 is worth ~+150k for the gate maker (84k -> 232k).
  * gate_thr / gate_window_us / gate_max_spread: drift = mid change over gate_window_us, sampled only
    while the spread is <= gate_max_spread (round2 has transient one-sided gaps of 10-80 ticks that are
    63 % of the mid variance; they must not trip the gate). |drift| >= gate_thr pulls the against-trend
    side (bid when falling, ask when rising). gate_thr 0 = off (identical to exp_ladder_home).
  * gate_rungs: 1 = the gate also cancels that side's rungs and parked stubs.

exp_ladder (H11): mm_park + standing "ladder" rungs behind the touch that are never moved.

  * ladder_size / ladder_depth / ladder_reserve: per side keep one ladder_size-lot order at each of
    touch-1 .. touch-ladder_depth (mirrored on the ask), placed once and then left alone while inside the
    window, so when the price arrives they are already at the front of the new touch queue (queue position
    is the edge: 0 lots ahead +0.21 $/lot, 500+ ahead loses). Rungs deeper than the window, or better than
    the touch, are cancelled. Rungs count in OUT_k; ladder_reserve 1 = touch quote first, rungs from what is
    left; 0 = rungs first, the touch quote takes the rest. ladder_size 0 = off (identical to mm_park).
    The invariant gate in _send is untouched.

mm_park (radys): exp_full_capacity + parked 20-lot stubs (park_size 20, park_depth 1, park_max 3) baked in.
round1 local pnl 452,651 vs champion 425,708.

exp_shrink (radys): exp_queue + park a stub instead of cancelling when the market improves past us.

  * park_size / park_depth / park_max: when the touch quote must move to a better price, the old order is
    shrunk with modify_order to park_size lots (keeps its queue priority, simulator reduces in place)
    instead of being cancelled; the freed room goes to the new touch quote. A parked stub is cancelled
    once it is more than park_depth ticks behind the market touch, or when the side has more than
    park_max stubs (oldest first). round1: fills with 0 lots ahead earn +0.21 $/lot, every cancel
    sends us to the back of a ~900-lot queue. park_size 0 = off.

Built from exp_queue (radys): exp_flow_pull + thin-level pull.

  * thin_pull: pull a side when the MARKET quantity at its touch (our own orders excluded) is below
    thin_pull lots, and quote it again only once it is back above thin_pull * thin_rejoin (hysteresis).
    round1 fill analysis: our fills on levels with < 100 market lots have 1 s edge -0.12..-0.49 $/lot
    (the level is about to be depleted and the price moves through us), > 1000 lots +0.32. 0 = off.

Built from exp_flow_pull (radys): exp_layers + pull after big aggressive trades.

  * flow_pull_qty / flow_pull_us: when one book update carries >= flow_pull_qty lots of
    buyer-initiated volume (book_side 'ask'), pull our ask for flow_pull_us (and the bid after
    seller-initiated volume). round1: mid moves +0.52 tick in the aggressor's direction within 1 s
    after p90+ trades, so the side the flow hits next is adversely selected. 0 = off.

Built from exp_layers (radys): exp_imb_pull + a second resting level per side.

  * layer_size / layer_offset: besides the touch quote, keep up to layer_size lots per side
    layer_offset ticks behind it (bid - offset / ask + offset). Big sweeps that reach it revert
    (sample_v2: -0.13 tick after big trades), so the deeper fill is cheaper. The invariant is
    unchanged: both levels count in OUT_k; the touch quote is served first. 0 = off.

Built from exp_imb_pull (radys): Honza's mm.py + adverse-selection pull filter.

Change vs mm.py (both off by default = identical to mm.py):
  * imb_pull: when L1 imbalance (qb - qa)/(qb + qa) < -imb_pull, pull the bid (price about to
    fall through it); when > +imb_pull, pull the ask. sample_v2: L1 imbalance corr with the
    100 ms forward mid is +0.35, so the side we pull is the one about to be run over.
  * inv_stop: stop quoting the side that would grow |I| once |I| >= inv_stop.

Original mm.py docstring:
Parametric two-sided market maker whose position limit is enforced by construction.

Quotes one passive LIMIT order per side at (or one tick inside) the market touch, shifted
by an inventory skew and an optional L1-imbalance alpha. Every tunable lives in
`MarketMaker.PARAMS` (the team runner overrides it by subclassing); `__init__` reads it
only through `self.PARAMS[...]`.

HARD INVARIANT (why the 10,000/s penalty cannot happen)
-------------------------------------------------------
Let M = max_position (clamped to <= 100, the exchange limit), I = our inventory, and for
side k let OUT_k be the sum of `remaining` over every order of ours on that side that is
not yet known to be dead: in flight to the exchange, resting, or resting with a cancel in
flight (a cancel can lose the race against a fill, so it counts until CANCELED arrives).
With s_buy = +1 and s_sell = -1 we keep, at every moment our code can observe,

    (B)  I + OUT_buy  <= M        and        (S)  -I + OUT_sell <= M.

Proof by induction over the only events that change I or OUT:
  * `_send` (the only place an order is created) refuses any q with s*I + OUT_k + q > M,
    so a new order keeps (B)/(S).
  * Buy fill of f: I += f, OUT_buy -= f, so (B) is unchanged and -I + OUT_sell drops by f.
    Sell fill symmetric. The simulator reports each fill synchronously, after updating its
    own inventory and before anything else can happen, so our I equals the exchange's I.
  * CANCELED, REJECTED, MODIFIED and IOC residuals only lower OUT_k.
  * A market cancel never touches our orders, and an order's remaining quantity never grows.
`remaining` here is an upper bound on what the exchange can still fill, so every fill that
can ever happen is already counted in OUT. Since OUT_k >= 0, (B) and (S) give
-M <= I <= M at all times: |I| <= M <= 100, hence zero breach penalty, even if every
outstanding order fills.
The reject rule |I + s(R + q)| > 1000 can never fire either: R + q <= OUT_k (+q), so
s*I + R + q <= M <= 100, and s*I >= -M, so the value lies in [-100, 100].
